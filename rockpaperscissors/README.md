**How to contribute**

I'm always looking for collaborations and particularly welcome from developers looking to improve the existing code, or add new features to the application.


## Submitting changes

Please send a pull request with a clear list of what you've done (read more about [pull requests](http://help.github.com/pull-requests/)). When you send a pull request, please make sure that there is only one feature added/changed per commit. Please attach a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:

```
$ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit
> 
> A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."
```

## Thanks

If you have read this far, thanks. I'm always looking for feedback and collaborations. Feel free to give me a shout.
